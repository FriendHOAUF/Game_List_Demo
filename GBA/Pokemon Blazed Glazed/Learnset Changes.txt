This is just to get a general idea of which Pokémon were buffed compared to the regular Glazed.
I actually replaced moves in level-ups for the most part, replacing them with moves that were better.
This means that some level-up sets are a total clustertruck.

Pokémon that are in lowercase = new Pokémon I added in, so they haven’t been buffed from the
original Glazed due to not existing then. :P
Any moves that are illegal normally on a Pokémon I have added will be noted.

Pokemon with stone evolutions now have similar level-up patterns with their pre-evos.

Any Pokémon that follows a level-up pattern from a later generation obviously have omitted moves,
mainly before their level they evolved.

Trust me, you are better off looking through the ROM with a Pokémon editor tool for more details.
